Project 7: Feature Optimization for Classification Problems using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
Project Title: Feature Optimization for Classification Problems using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
Project Goal: To enhance the performance and interpretability of a classification model by optimizing its feature set. This project will leverage Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) on the Titanic dataset to identify the most impactful features for predicting survival, followed by a comparative analysis of model performance with and without the reduced feature set.
Objectives:
1. Dataset Preparation:
o Utilize a preprocessed and feature-engineered version of the Titanic dataset (as prepared in previous projects, if applicable).
o Ensure the dataset is ready for classification modeling, with features (X) and the target variable (y, 'Survived') clearly defined.
2. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) Implementation:
o Apply Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to the dataset.
o Select an appropriate base estimator (e.g., Logistic Regression or a tree-based model) for RFE.
o Determine the optimal number of features to select using RFE with cross-validation. This will involve iterating RFE to find the feature subset that maximizes a chosen performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).
3. Model Training and Performance Comparison:
o Baseline Model: Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Decision Tree, consistent with RFE's estimator) using all available features from the prepared dataset. Evaluate its performance on a held-out test set using relevant classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
o Optimized Model: Train the same classification model using only the features selected by RFE. Evaluate its performance on the same held-out test set using the identical set of classification metrics.
4. Results Analysis and Documentation:
o Present the list of features selected by RFE and the rationale behind their selection.
o Provide a comparative analysis of the performance metrics between the baseline model (all features) and the RFE-optimized model (selected features).
o Discuss the implications of feature optimization on model performance, complexity, and interpretability.
Tools/Libraries:
• Python 3.x
• Pandas (for data manipulation)
• Scikit-learn (for RFE: RFE, RFECV; classification models: LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier; and evaluation metrics: accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, classification_report)
• NumPy (for numerical operations, if needed)
Deliverables:
• A well-structured and commented Python script (.py or .ipynb) that implements the RFE process, trains both models, and performs the comparative analysis.
• Clear output displaying:
o The list of features selected by RFE.
o The classification performance metrics for the baseline model (using all features).
o The classification performance metrics for the RFE-optimized model (using selected features).
• A written analysis (within comments or markdown cells) interpreting the results, discussing the impact of feature reduction on model performance and potential benefits (e.g., faster training, better generalization, reduced overfitting).
Success Criteria:
• RFE is correctly applied to select an optimal subset of features.
• Both the baseline model and the RFE-optimized model are trained and evaluated effectively.
• A comprehensive comparison of their performance metrics is provided.
• The analysis clearly articulates the benefits or drawbacks of feature optimization in this context.
• The code is robust, readable, and reproducible.
